Sabbat location core service
-----------------------------
the location service is an location tracker of users location and computes several facts:
* Distance between other users of a group (e.g. between to friends of a race biking group)
* Notification of users when conditions to be configured are met (e.g. they are close to each other). Here the internal messenger service can be used.
* Calculate fastest route between them
